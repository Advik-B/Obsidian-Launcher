This log output looks fantastic! It shows that many core pieces of your C# port are working correctly:

1.  **Configuration (`LauncherConfig`)**: Paths are being resolved and used.
2.  **Logging (`LoggerSetup` with Serilog)**: Logging is initialized and providing detailed, contextual information (e.g., `[ObsidianLauncher.Services.JavaManager]`).
3.  **Java Runtime Discovery (`JavaManager.ScanForExistingRuntimes`)**: It successfully scanned your `java_runtimes` directory, identified an existing Adoptium JRE (version 17, component `java-runtime-gamma`), and correctly found its executable.
4.  **HTTP (`HttpManager`)**: Successfully fetched both the main version manifest and the specific version JSON for 1.20.4 from Mojang's servers.
5.  **JSON Deserialization (`System.Text.Json`)**:
    *   Correctly parsed the main `version_manifest_v2.json` (presumably into your `VersionManifest` model).
    *   Correctly parsed the `1.20.4.json` file (presumably into your `MinecraftVersion` model).
6.  **Java Version Requirement Identification**: Correctly identified that Minecraft 1.20.4 requires "java-runtime-gamma" major version 17.
7.  **Java Runtime Matching (`JavaManager.EnsureJavaForMinecraftVersionAsync`)**: Correctly matched the required Java version with the one it discovered locally, so no download was necessary.
8.  **Overall Flow**: The `Program.cs` is orchestrating these steps correctly.

The renaming of `*Service` to `*` (e.g., `JavaManagerService` to `JavaManager`) is a perfectly valid stylistic choice and doesn't affect functionality as long as it's consistent.

**Next Steps Based on Your Placeholders:**

The log clearly shows the placeholders for the next crucial stages. Here's a brief outline of what each would involve:

### 1. Asset Download/Verification

*   **Service Class:** You'll likely want an `AssetManager.cs`.
*   **Input:** `MinecraftVersion.AssetIndex` object and `LauncherConfig`.
*   **Logic:**
    1.  **Get Asset Index URL:** From `minecraftVersion.AssetIndex.Url`.
    2.  **Download Asset Index JSON:**
        *   Check if the index file (e.g., `config.AssetIndexesDir / minecraftVersion.AssetIndex.Id + ".json"`) already exists.
        *   If it exists, verify its SHA1 hash against `minecraftVersion.AssetIndex.Sha1`.
        *   If it doesn't exist or the hash mismatches, download it using `HttpManager`.
    3.  **Parse Asset Index JSON:** Deserialize this JSON. It will contain an "objects" map where keys are paths like "minecraft/textures/block/stone.png" and values are objects containing the asset's "hash" (SHA1) and "size".
        *   You'll need a model for this, e.g., `AssetObject.cs` and `AssetIndexDetails.cs`.
    4.  **Download/Verify Individual Assets:**
        *   For each asset object in the parsed index:
            *   The **SHA1 hash** is the key.
            *   The **target path** for the asset is `config.AssetObjectsDir / hash.substring(0, 2) / hash`. (e.g., `assets/objects/de/deadbeef...`).
            *   Check if this target file exists.
            *   If it exists, verify its SHA1 hash against the "hash" from the asset index.
            *   If it doesn't exist or hash mismatches, download it from `https://resources.download.minecraft.net/` + `hash.substring(0, 2)` + `/` + `hash`.
            *   Verify the downloaded asset's SHA1.
    5.  **Legacy Assets:** For older versions (pre-1.7.10, identified by `minecraftVersion.Assets == "legacy"` or `minecraftVersion.Assets == "pre-1.6"`), assets are often downloaded to `config.AssetsDir / "virtual" / "legacy"` and might have different naming conventions or might be directly in the client JAR. This requires special handling if you support very old versions.

### 2. Library Download/Verification

*   **Service Class:** Could be part of `JavaManager` or a new `LibraryManager.cs`.
*   **Input:** `MinecraftVersion.Libraries` list and `LauncherConfig`.
*   **Logic:**
    1.  **Iterate through `minecraftVersion.Libraries`:**
    2.  **Check Rules:** For each library, evaluate its `Rules` (using `OsUtils` and any feature flags you implement) to see if it's applicable to the current OS/environment.
        *   Implement the `EvaluateRules` function you conceptualized earlier.
    3.  **Download Main Artifact:**
        *   If the library is applicable and `library.Downloads.Artifact` is present:
            *   The **target path** is `config.LibrariesDir / library.Downloads.Artifact.Path`.
            *   Check if it exists.
            *   If it exists, verify its SHA1 against `library.Downloads.Artifact.Sha1`.
            *   If not, download from `library.Downloads.Artifact.Url`. Verify SHA1.
    4.  **Handle Natives:**
        *   If `library.Natives` is present for the current OS (e.g., `library.Natives.TryGetValue(OsUtils.GetShortOsName(), out string nativeClassifierKey)`):
            *   Get the `LibraryArtifact` for this native classifier from `library.Downloads.Classifiers[nativeClassifierKey]`.
            *   Download and verify this native JAR (similar to the main artifact). Its path will be in `nativeArtifact.Path`.
            *   **Extract Natives:**
                *   The natives need to be extracted to a specific directory (e.g., `config.VersionsDir / minecraftVersion.Id / minecraftVersion.Id + "-natives"` or a temporary directory).
                *   Use `System.IO.Compression.ZipFile.OpenRead()` to open the native JAR.
                *   Iterate through `ZipArchiveEntry` in the native JAR.
                *   For each entry, check if its `FullName` is excluded by any rule in `library.Extract.Exclude`.
                *   If not excluded, extract the entry to the natives directory: `entry.ExtractToFile(Path.Combine(nativesExtractionDir, entry.Name), true);`.
                *   Remember to create subdirectories within `nativesExtractionDir` if `entry.FullName` contains them.

### 3. Classpath Construction

*   **Service Class:** A new `LaunchProfileBuilder.cs` or similar.
*   **Input:** `MinecraftVersion`, `LauncherConfig`, list of applicable library paths, path to client JAR.
*   **Logic:**
    1.  Create a `List<string>` for classpath entries.
    2.  **Add Client JAR:** The path to the downloaded client JAR for the current version (e.g., `config.VersionsDir / minecraftVersion.Id / minecraftVersion.Id + ".jar"`). You'll need to download this from `minecraftVersion.Downloads["client"].Url`.
    3.  **Add Library JARs:** For every applicable library (from step 2), add the full path to its main JAR file to the list.
    4.  Join the list into a single classpath string, using `Path.PathSeparator` (`;` on Windows, `:` on Linux/macOS).

### 4. JVM Argument Construction

*   **Service Class:** `LaunchProfileBuilder.cs`.
*   **Input:** `MinecraftVersion`, `LauncherConfig`, classpath string, path to natives directory, user auth info.
*   **Logic:**
    1.  Create a `List<string>` for JVM arguments.
    2.  **Process `minecraftVersion.Arguments.Jvm`:**
        *   Iterate through the list.
        *   If a `VersionArgument` is a plain string, add it.
        *   If it's conditional, evaluate its rules. If applicable, add its value(s).
        *   **Replace Placeholders:**
            *   `${natives_directory}`: Path to where native libraries were extracted.
            *   `${launcher_name}`: "ObsidianLauncher"
            *   `${launcher_version}`: "0.1"
            *   `${classpath}`: The constructed classpath string.
            *   `${library_path}` / `${classpath_separator}`: Might also be used.
            *   `${version_name}`: `minecraftVersion.Id`
            *   `${game_directory}`: `config.BaseDataPath` (or a specific instance path)
            *   `${assets_root}`: `config.AssetsDir`
            *   `${assets_index_name}`: `minecraftVersion.AssetIndex.Id` or `minecraftVersion.Assets`
            *   Memory arguments like `-Xmx2G`, `-Xms2G` (these might be configurable).
    3.  **Add Client Logging Argument:**
        *   If `minecraftVersion.Logging.Client` is present:
            *   Download `minecraftVersion.Logging.Client.File.Url` to a known location (e.g., `config.AssetsDir / "log_configs" / minecraftVersion.Logging.Client.File.Id`).
            *   Verify its SHA1.
            *   Take `minecraftVersion.Logging.Client.Argument` (e.g., `"-Dlog4j.configurationFile=${path}"`) and replace `${path}` with the full path to the downloaded logging config file. Add this to JVM args.
    4.  **Add Main Class:** `minecraftVersion.MainClass`.
    5.  Ensure all paths are properly quoted if they contain spaces.

### 5. Game Argument Construction

*   **Service Class:** `LaunchProfileBuilder.cs`.
*   **Input:** `MinecraftVersion`, user auth info, window size info.
*   **Logic:**
    1.  Create a `List<string>` for game arguments.
    2.  **Process `minecraftVersion.Arguments.Game`** (or `minecraftVersion.MinecraftArguments` for very old versions):
        *   Similar to JVM args, iterate, evaluate rules, add values.
        *   **Replace Placeholders:**
            *   `${auth_player_name}`
            *   `${version_name}` (same as `minecraftVersion.Id`)
            *   `${game_directory}`
            *   `${assets_root}`
            *   `${assets_index_name}`
            *   `${auth_uuid}`
            *   `${auth_access_token}`
            *   `${clientid}` (optional, for some analytics)
            *   `${auth_xuid}` (optional, for Xbox Live auth)
            *   `${user_type}` ("msa", "legacy")
            *   `${version_type}` (e.g., "release", "snapshot")
            *   `${resolution_width}`, `${resolution_height}` (if you allow configuring this)
            *   `--demo` (if `minecraftVersion.Arguments.Game` contains a feature rule for `is_demo_user`)
    3.  Ensure all paths are properly quoted.

### 6. Launch Minecraft

*   **Service Class:** `GameLauncher.cs` or part of `LaunchProfileBuilder.cs`.
*   **Input:** Path to Java executable, constructed JVM arguments, constructed game arguments, working directory.
*   **Logic:**
    1.  Use `System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo` and `System.Diagnostics.Process`.
    2.  `FileName`: `javaRuntime.JavaExecutablePath`.
    3.  `Arguments`: Concatenate all JVM arguments, the main class, and then all game arguments, each separated by spaces. Ensure proper quoting.
    4.  `WorkingDirectory`: Usually your main data directory (`launcherConfig.BaseDataPath`) or a specific game instance subfolder.
    5.  `RedirectStandardOutput = true`, `RedirectStandardError = true`, `UseShellExecute = false`: To capture Minecraft's console output for your launcher's log or UI.
    6.  Start the process: `Process.Start(startInfo)`.
    7.  Optionally, read from `process.StandardOutput` and `process.StandardError` asynchronously to display/log Minecraft's output.
    8.  Wait for the process to exit: `process.WaitForExit()` or `await process.WaitForExitAsync()`.

This is a high-level overview. Each of these "TODO" steps is a significant piece of work involving careful parsing, rule evaluation, string manipulation, and file operations. Good luck with the rest of the port! Your progress so far is excellent.
